# webtreemap CLI

No frills treemap visualization from the command line. Includes built-in facilities for
visualizing space using on disk or in a JSON file, but the simple input format makes it
easy to create a treemap visualization of anything you like.

See a demo of what the visualization looks like [here][demo].

## Usage

Install with

    npm install -g webtreemap-cli

Then run with:

    treemap < my_data

Input data format is whitespace-separated lines of `size path`, where size
is a number and path is a '/'-delimited path. For example:

    $ cat my_data
    100 all
    50 all/thing1
    25 all/thing2

If the number is omitted, it is assumed to be `1`. This lets you visualize the number of
files in each directory using the `find` command, for example:

    find . -type f | treemap

Note that there's nothing file-system-specific about the data format -- it
just uses slash as a nesting delimiter.

## Special inputs

The previous section described the general input format. The `treemap` binary also includes
subcommands for a few specific use cases that come up frequently in practice.

### Disk usage of a directory

i.e. "why is node_modules so big!?"

    treemap du node_modules

### Space used in a JSON file

JSON is ubiquitous, but it's not known for making efficient use of space. You can visualize
why a JSON file is large using the `du:json` subcommand:

    treemap du:json file.json

For a [GeoJSON] file, for example, this can tell you whether feature geometries or properties
are using more bytes. If it's geometries, then [TopoJSON] might be helpful. If it's properties,
then you'll need to think more about how you're structuring your data.

### Space used in a source map

See [source-map-explorer].

## Options

- `-f, --format [format]`

  Set the output format. By default this is HTML. You may also output JSON or text, which produces a format that may be fed back into `treemap`. This is useful if you want to use one of the special inputs but edit the results before visualization.

- `-o, --output [path]`

  Output to a file rather than opening a web browser or printing to stdout (depending on the output format). If `-o` is specified but not `-f`, then the output format will be set based on the output file name's extension.

- `--title [string]`

  Set the page title for HTML output.

## Development

Run:

    yarn build
    yarn demo

Develop:

    yarn watch
    yarn demo

Format code:

    yarn fmt
